### Buying Behavior

Problem 3: From the data, can you find any behavioral patterns that help us understand how consumers buy new vehicles?  Can the tendencies you found (if any) be applied to the general population?  Support your answer with models / visualizations / analyses, as appropriate.

### Overview

We examine buying behavior from several different angles, including age, price, miles traveled, and brand loyalty. This charts on this page may take a while to load so please be patient. 

### By Year / Age of Vehicle

We first examine if there are any patterns with respect to the age of the car. The follwing is a bar chart illustrating the distribution of the age/years of the cars that were traded in during the program. 

#### Number of Cars Traded In by Model Year

We see that most people in this dataset buy a new car when their current one is approximately 10-15 years old. Cars newer than that were rarely traded in. This is not necessarily directly applicable to the general population but it seems reasonable to assume that when not incentivized by the program the distribution would be shifted over to the left some and people would wait longer.

The following is a map showing the average age of cars that were traded in for each state:

#### Average Age of Cars Traded In by State

<div class="chart" id="age-map">Loading...</div>

We see that vehicles in the northwest tended to be older, which could suggest customers in those areas are less frequent purchasers of cars or had more old gas guzzling vehicles than other states. The tendencies can probably be applied to the general population in those states.

### By Odometer Mileage

In some ways this is another, possibly more accurate, way of measuring the age of the vehicles being traded in. The following is a chart illustrating the distribution of the miles on the vehicles that were traded in.

#### Number of Cars Traded In by Odometer Reading (Miles)

<div class="chart" id="odometer-bar-chart">Loading...</div>

It similarly follows a semi-normal distribution. Customers are unlikely to trade in cars with fewer miles on it, were most likely to trade in vehicles with 100K to 200K miles and there likely aren't too many cars with 200+K miles on them so there were not traded in too often. Similar to the age, in the general population this distribution is likely to be shifted somewhat to the left since they don't have the same incentives but should follow a similar pattern.

The following is a map showing the average miles on a car being traded in for each state. 

#### Average Odometer Reading (Miles) of Cars Traded In by State

<div class="chart" id="odom-map">Loading...</div>

The map appears significantly different from the age map. The map appears to suggest that customers in the mid to midwestern US drive their cars longer before trading them in. 

### By Price

We now examine the effect of price the newly purchased car. Below is a chart showing the cars bought in given price ranges. 

#### Number of Cars Purchased by MSRP

<div class="chart" id="price-bar-chart">Loading...</div>

Similar to age and miles, this is probably not entirely representative of the general population since the customers here got about $4500 off their purchase, but it seems reasonable to think the distribution would be shifted left in the general population.

The following is a map showing the average price of a car being bought for each state.

#### Average MSRP of New Car Purchased by State

<div class="chart" id="msrp-map">Loading...</div>

We see that in the northern central United States, vehicles purchased tend to be more expensive, though the range is generally not too high. 

### By Brand Loyalty

The following is a bar chart showing the number of customers who stayed with the same brand of car or switched to a new one. 

#### Number of Customers Switching Brands vs. Staying with Same Brand

<div class="chart" id="loyalty-bar-chart"></div>

We see that brand loyalty tends to be low, with only Toyota having at least half as many customers who stayed with them as switched. This is not representative of the general population because this sample was specifically incentivized to turn in fuel-costly vehicles for more fuel-efficient ones, which would bias the results in favor of certain brands who make more fuel-efficient vehicles.

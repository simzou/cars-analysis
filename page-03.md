### Buying Behavior

Problem 3: From the data, can you find any behavioral patterns that help us understand how consumers buy new vehicles?  Can the tendencies you found (if any) be applied to the general population?  Support your answer with models / visualizations / analyses, as appropriate.

### Overview

We examine buying behavior from several different angles, including age, price, miles traveled, and brand loyalty. This charts on this page may take a while to load so please be patient. 

### By Year / Age of Vehicle

We first examine if there are any patterns with respect to the age of the car.

### West Coast = Best Coast?

Problem 2: Did West Coast consumers purchase more fuel efficient cars than consumers in other regions?  Please support your answer with analysis and visualizations.

### Clarifying "Regions"

We use a tweaked version of the Census Bureau's definition of [regions in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_regions_of_the_United_States), which is as follows:

 - **Northeast** (Region 1): Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania
 - **Midwest** (Region 2): llinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin, West North Central (Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota
 - **South** (Region 3): Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia, Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee, Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas
 - **West** (Region 4): Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, Wyoming, Alaska, California, Hawaii, Oregon, and Washington

 For this question, we split Califonia, Washington, and Oregon off from Region 4 so that instead of Region 4, we have:

 - **West** (Region 4): Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, Wyoming, Alaska, and Hawaii
 - **West Coast** (Region 5): California, Oregon, and Washington

### Analysis and Charts

Here is a pie chart showing the transactions by region.

The west coast, even including the the rest of the western states did not purchase more cars than other regions.

Here's a map showing transactions by state:

While California purchased more cars than any other state, other regions generally had multiple regions with high amounts of car purchases so the west coast as a region did not purchase more fuel efficient cars than consumers in other regions.

Technical Plan
	- delete unnecessary columns
	- underscore + javascript visualizations
	- javascript libraries to visualize

Science Plan
1) Possible metrics
	- average mpg improvement
	- goverment dollars spent per mpg improvement
	- simple count of trade-ins
		- not really fair since I don't want to go about normalizing by population
		- though if you use a database, you could...
		- would have to get maybe data on other cars...
		- too complicated
	- percent of traded in trucks
	- percent of bought passenger cars
	- percent of cars traded in for a better category
		- mpg is better than this

	Graphics to make:
		Top 10 by cost effectiveness
		Bottom 10 by cost effectiveness
		Top 10 by mpg improvement 
		Bottom 10 by mpg improvement
		Map of mpg improvement
		Map of cost effectivness

2) Manually define region for state
	Map it out

	Graphics to make:
		Map of sales per state
		Pie chart of sales per region

3) Do people trade in older cars
	Count by year
	okay to do since all sales are over 2 month period in same year
   Do people trade in cars with more miles
   	Count by year
   Do people switch makes/models
   	Double bar chart

   	Graphics to make:
   		Bar chart: x axis age of car, y-axis: num traded in
   		Bar chart: x axis miles on car, y-axis: num traded in
   		Bar chart: x axis: make, y-axis: num switched, num stayed
   		Bar chart: x axis: price range, y-axis: num bought

   	Not all that applicable to general population

4) Would need to know how many cars proportionally were switched

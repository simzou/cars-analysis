### A wild success?

Problem 4: The program was declared “wildly successful” by the government.  Is there sufficient data from NHTSA to support that conclusion?  If not, what additional data will you need in order to determine if the government was right?  Explain why this additional data is needed and what you would use it for.  (You are not expected to actually go and find that extra data.)  If you don’t need additional data, was the government right -- and why? 

### Response

There is not sufficient data to support that conclusion. This is partially because "success" is not necessarily well defined (Is it more sales of greener cars? More car sales in general? Job creation? Environmental impact?). However, even if we assume certain metrics of success, we do not have a control for the experiment. For example, if the number of nearly 700,000 cars being sold to be considered successful, we would need to find out what the normal rate of people trading in their older vehicles for greener ones was around this time (or at another time when the economy/gas prices were similar).
